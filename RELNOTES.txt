1. Introduction

   Welcome to Equalizer, the standard middleware to create and deploy
   parallel, scalable OpenGL applications. This release introduces major new
   features, most notably asynchronous readbacks, region of interest and
   thread affinity for increased performance during scalable rendering.

   Equalizer 1.4 is a feature release extending the 1.0 API, distilling over
   seven years of development and decades of experience into a feature-rich,
   high-performance and mature parallel rendering framework and an
   object-oriented high-level network library. It is intended for all
   application developers creating parallel, interactive OpenGL applications.
   Equalizer 1.4 can be retrieved by downloading the source code or one of
   the precompiled packages.

  1.1. Features

   Equalizer provides the following major features to facilitate the
   development and deployment of scalable OpenGL applications. A detailed
   feature list can be found on the Equalizer website.

     * Runtime Configurability: An Equalizer application is configured
       automatically or manually at runtime and can be deployed on laptops,
       multi-GPU workstations and large-scale visualization clusters without
       recompilation.
     * Runtime Scalability: An Equalizer application can benefit from
       multiple graphics cards, processors and computers to scale rendering
       performance, visual quality and display size.
     * Distributed Execution: Equalizer applications can be written to
       support cluster-based execution. Equalizer furnishes and uses the
       Collage network library, a cross-platform C++ library for building
       heterogenous, distributed applications.
     * Support for Stereo and Immersive Environments: Equalizer supports
       stereo rendering head tracking, head-mounted displays and other
       advanced features for immersive Virtual Reality installations.

2. New in this release

   Equalizer 1.4 contains the following features, enhancements, bug fixes and
   documentation changes:

  2.1. New Features

     * Asynchronous readback support
     * Automatic CPU-GPU affinity
     * Application-specific scaling to visualize data in a scale different to
       1:1 in immersive environments
     * VirtualGL-aware auto-configuration
     * Region of interest for scalable rendering and load-balancing
     * Zeroconf support and node discovery
     * Blocking co::Object::commit
     * Extensible packet dispatch

  2.2. Enhancements

     * System window without drawable buffer
     * Mac OS X: Build universal libraries even when AGL is enabled
     * auto-config: add direct send configuration

     * auto-config: application-specific flags for multiprocess execution

  2.3. Optimizations

     * Multi-GPU NVidia optimization
     * load_equalizer: split along longest axis in 2D mode
     * InfiniBand RDMA: significant performance increase using a different
       underlying implementation

  2.4. Examples

     * eqPly: Add command line option to disable region of interest
     * eqPly: Parallel kd-tree construction when using gcc 4.4 or later
     * eqPly: runtime-changeable model unit scaling
     * eqPly: Create all VBOs/display lists during the first frame

  2.5. Tools

     * eqPlyConverter: New offline tool to generate binary cache for eqPly

  2.6. Documentation

   The following documentation has been added or substantially improved since
   the last release:

     * Full API documentation for the public Equalizer API
     * The Programming and User Guide has been extended to 107 pages and 60
       figures
     * Tile compounds using a pull-based task distribution for volume
       rendering and interactive raytracing

  2.7. Bug Fixes

   Equalizer 1.4 includes various bugfixes over the 1.2.1 release, including
   the following:

     * 139: Tile compound readback broken
     * 120: Async readback deallocation

3. About

   Equalizer is a cross-platform toolkit, designed to run on any modern
   operating system, including all Unix variants and the Windows operating
   system. A compatibility matrix can be found on the Equalizer website.

   Equalizer requires at least OpenGL 1.1, but uses newer OpenGL features
   when available. Version 1.4 has been tested on:

  3.1. Operating System Support

   Equalizer uses CMake to create a platform-specific build environment. The
   following platforms and build environments are tested:

     * Linux: Ubuntu 11.10, 12.04, RHEL 6.1 (Makefile, i386, x64)
     * Windows: 7 (Visual Studio 2008, i386, x64)
     * Mac OS X: 10.7 (Makefile, XCode, i386, x64)

  3.2. Window System Support

     * X11: Full support for all documented features
     * WGL: Full support for all documented features
     * AGL: Full support for all documented features

  3.3. Documentation

   The Programming and User Guide is available as a hard-copy and online. The
   API documentation can be found on the Equalizer website.

   As with any open source project, the available source code, in particular
   the shipped examples provide a reference for developing or porting
   applications. The Developer Documentation on the website provides further
   design documents for specific features. XCode users can download a
   Documentation Set.
