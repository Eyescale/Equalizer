1. Introduction

   Welcome to Equalizer, the standard middleware to create and
   deploy parallel, scalable OpenGL applications. This release
   introduces major new features, most notably automatic
   configuration, the Sequel library, runtime reliability and
   tile compounds.

   Equalizer 1.2 is a feature release extending the 1.0 API,
   distilling over 6 years of development and decades of
   experience into a feature-rich, high-performance and mature
   parallel rendering framework and an object-oriented
   high-level network library. It is intended for all
   application developers creating parallel, interactive
   OpenGL applications. Equalizer 1.2 can be retrieved by
   downloading the source code or one of the precompiled
   packages.

  1.1. Features

   Equalizer provides the following major features to
   facilitate the development and deployment of scalable
   OpenGL applications. A detailed feature list can be found
   on the Equalizer website.

     * Runtime Configurability: An Equalizer application is
       configured automatically or manually at runtime and can
       be deployed on laptops, multi-GPU workstations and
       large-scale visualization clusters without
       recompilation.
     * Runtime Scalability: An Equalizer application can
       benefit from multiple graphics cards, processors and
       computers to scale rendering performance, visual
       quality and display size.
     * Distributed Execution: Equalizer applications can be
       written to support cluster-based execution. Equalizer
       furnishes and uses the Collage network library, a
       cross-platform C++ library for building heterogenous,
       distributed applications.
     * Support for Stereo and Immersive Environments:
       Equalizer supports both active and passive stereo
       rendering, as well as head tracking and head-mounted
       displays used in immersive Virtual Reality
       installations.

2. New in this release

   Equalizer 1.2 contains the following features,
   enhancements, bug fixes and documentation changes:

  2.1. New Features

     * Automatic local and remote configuration using the
       GPU-SD library
     * Initial release of Sequel, a simplification and utility
       layer on top of Equalizer, enabling rapid development
       of clustered multi-GPU applications
     * Runtime failure tolerance detecting hardware and
       software failures
     * Tile compounds for fill-limited rendering such as
       direct volume rendering and interactive raytracing
     * Distributed single-producer, multi-consumer queue
     * RDMA-based connection class for InfiniBand (Linux only)
     * Support push-based object distribution

  2.2. Enhancements

     * Added FindEqualizer.cmake and FindCollage.cmake for
       integration of Equalizer and Collage in CMake build
       environments
     * Support for render clients without listening sockets
     * Per-segment or per-canvas swap barriers
     * Allow the image compressor to be chosen by the
       application
     * Allow and prefer external GLEW installation during
       compilation
     * Upgrade internal GLEW version to 1.7.0
     * Implement EQ_WINDOW_IATTR_HINT_SWAPSYNC for GLX
     * Add time member to eq::Event recording time when the
       event was received from the operating system
     * 43: Add View::isActive and Layout::isActive
     * 45: Make RNG functional without co::base::init
     * Implement maximum size of multi-threaded queue,
       resulting in blocking push operations
     * Extend co::base::SpinLock and ScopedMutex with
       read-write semantics
     * Make Collage usable from multiple libraries by allowing
       init and exit to be called multiple times

  2.3. Optimizations

     * Make LocalNode::registerObject and Object::commit
       parallelizable by executing object serialization from
       calling thread

  2.4. Examples

     * Provide CMake files for installed examples
     * seqPly: An new example similar to eqPly, but using the
       Sequel API
     * eqAsync: A new example demonstrating OpenGL context
       sharing for asynchronously texture uploads
     * eqHello: Ported to Sequel

  2.5. Tools

     * No Changes

  2.6. API Changes

   The following API changes may impact existing applications:

     * Removed co::Object::commitNB and commitSync since the
       commit request is no longer dispatched to command
       thread. Use commit instead.
     * Moved installed client headers to eq/client.
       Applications should always use eq/eq.h instead of
       individual headers.
     * Added a return value and timeout to
       co::LocalNode::acquireSendToken(), see method
       documentation.
     * Changed 'uint32_t eq::Version::getRevision()' to
       'std::string eq::Version::getRevision()'

  2.7. Documentation

   The following documentation has been added or substantially
   improved since the last release:

     * Full API documentation for the public Equalizer API.
     * The Programming and User Guide has been extended to 107
       pages and 60 figures.
     * Tile compounds using a pull-based task distribution for
       volume rendering and interactive raytracing.

  2.8. Bug Fixes

   Equalizer 1.2 includes various bugfixes over the 1.0
   release, including the following:

     * RSP: Fix scattered ack implementation
     * 29: NV swap barrier with affinity context does not work
     * 45: Make co::base::RNG function without init()
     * 56: Parsing configuration files is locale-dependent and
